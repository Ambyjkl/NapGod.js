This module mentions people with specific genetic mutations that allow them to function at optimal level while thriving with much less sleep than a normal human being. We often need 7-8h of sleep per day (monophasic sleep) to be fully functional, however some people need less than 6h of total sleep each day. A common gene which affects the general sleep requirement is the DEC2 gene. The sleep compression can be much better than for regular people, enabling them to take on schedules like Uberman, Dymaxion, SPAMAYL, etc with the possibility to succeed long term. If you have lower sleep requirements, you should know that by the time you're an adult or so. Therefore, think twice before attempting these nap-only schedules, to maintain health benefits for long term.
