This module mentions people that have mutated genes that allow them to function at optimal level while thriving with much less sleep than a normal human being. We often need 7-8h of sleep per day (monophasic sleep) to be fully functional. With the mutants, they often need less than 6h of total sleep each day. A common gene for mutants that is mentioned a lot is DEC2 gene. Their sleep compression is much better than the non-mutants, enabling them to take on schedules like Uberman, Dymaxion, SPAMAYL, etc with ease. If you are a mutant, you should know that by the time you're an adult or so. Therefore, think twice before attempting these nap-only schedules, to maintain health benefits for long term.
