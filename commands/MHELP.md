--- Nap God moderator help ---

-----------------------------------------------
**To make the Nap God say something**: `+say [message]`
**To set someone's schedule and napchart**: `+mset [schedule-name] [napchart-link] [username]`. Only the standard schedules are supported. Use none in place of the napchart link if you want the user not to have a napchart (any existing chart they have will be removed).
