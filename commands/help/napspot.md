Try to avoid sleeping in bed since it increases the risk of oversleeping. Sleeping on a flat surface (with carpet) is recommended for spine assistance, waking on time, and other health benefits. It's possible to train yourself to sleep while sitting, being in a car or laying on an uncomfortable surface. Stick to it and you'll fall asleep eventually!
