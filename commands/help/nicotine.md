Nicotine should be completely avoided while doing a Polyphasic Sleeping schedule. Nicotine has a half life of about 2 hours after which it gets turned into cotine with a half-life of about 19 hours. Both of these are stimulants, which means they will make it harder to fall asleep and reduce the quality of the sleep you do get (replacing SWS and REM with light sleep). Nicotine can also alter the circadian rhythm.
