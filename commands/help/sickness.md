When you're sick with anything more than a mild flu (with symptoms above the neck), it's best to return to monosleep, to fully recover before continue polyphasic sleep. If you are adapted to a schedule and get sick, you can still be polyphasic, but lengthen your core sleep(s) and nap(s) to extend recovery. During sleep deprivation of polyphasic sleep, it will be worse for your immune system to resist sickness.
Try boosting your immune system before trying to adapt again. Make sure you're eating healthy, exercising and so on!

Naps can be replaced by an extra full cycle; do not use a random length.
