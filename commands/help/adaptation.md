First stage: 
Sleep and wake up are so easy in each sleep, core sleep and naps, because sleep deprivation hasn't kicked in. Sleep quality is the same as in monosleep. Sleep stages haven't compressed. Sleep cycle is still the same (90m one cycle, presumably).

Second stage: 
Starts feeling tired in the day, at some points of time. Waking up becomes harder, as total sleep is reduced. Feeling of sleepiness becomes more apparent, and sleep debts accumulate. 

Third stage:
This is where the screwups begin. Sleep debts accumulate enough to often cause an oversleep. Here it's important to maximize your alarms. (if and how much you oversleep depends on how much sleep you get in your schedule. The shorter it is, the more likely you are to oversleep). This is also the stage where you start to remember dreams in your nap(s)/core(s). Falling asleep becomes very hard for some sleeps, and during others you fall asleep very easily, but waking up from those is very hard. Repartitioning has begun. Your sleep cycle can be reduced, with the reduction of light sleep. 

Fourth stage: 
If you bypass stage 3 (by oversleeping only minimally/not at all) you enter atage 4! There's a clear difference between stage 3 and 4, where 4 feels more like stage 2. During this stage the symptoms get progressivly better. As time progresses you can start to wake naturally before alarm rings from time to time, have more vivid dreams, and falling asleep won't be an issue any longer. Waking up also becomes very easy, and you start to feel alert in the day. When nap times come, sleepiness sharply rise at that moment, and when you wake up from nap, you're fresh again till the next sleep. When you meet all !adapt-success signs you've adapted!
