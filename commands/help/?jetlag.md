Happens when you travel through different time zones. You will initially struggle to fall asleep fast in the new time zone, and your schedule will become a mess. Depends on how long your trip is, how long you stay in the new region, and depends on how long you have been polyphasic, and if you can maintain your schedule when on the plane, in the airport (sleep on schedule), you can avoid re-adapting to your original schedule. 

If you are determined to restart your schedule, just rest when you feel sleepy enough during travelling. If you're on a plane, try to get a core sleep (if you're on Everyman, or Dual Core), or a nap, and time so that when the plane lands, you wake up. If you have alarm clocks that can be useful in the plane, like android app, and want to stay on schedule, certainly use what you have. Nap in the airport if necessary. Try not to core in the airports, as you will be vulnerable to thefts, personal safety, etc...
