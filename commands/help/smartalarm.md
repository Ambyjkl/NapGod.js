App or smartband-based smartalarms will be very unreliable; since they rely on sub-par sleeptracking to work. (look at !sleeptracker for the accuracy reports; most are below 50% accurate.) 
The Zeo Bedside's "gentle wake up" could be considered if on mono; Wake up lights can be considered for mono, E1, Siesta, and the second core of Segmented. 

The different wake-up times of "smartalarms" will keep you from stabilizing to waking up the same time each day on your own. This means that in the long-term, you'd wake up feeling good on more days if you keep a regular alarm than if you'd use an unpredictable smart-alarm. Poly can't normally handle the random sleep reductions; cutting out 30m is a big deal.
