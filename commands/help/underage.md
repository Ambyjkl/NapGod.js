***Underage***
Under-aged people, especially those under 16 should avoid cutting any sleep at all. Those over 16 are strongly recommended to do one of the following schedules, since both their brain and body is still developing, and cutting out light sleep could have effects that are detrimental for the body in the future: 
- E1 (6h20m)
- Siesta (6h30, even Siesta-extended is plausable, clocking in at 7,5h sleep)
- Segmented (7h).

Siesta is good if you have no previous napping experience, since it has a full sleep cycle during the day (it's very easy to adapt to sleeping a full cycle, since both rem and sws could easily be inserted into it). Siesta has a 5h core in the night, and a 1,5h core in the day. Siesta-extended is even more favoured for underaged people, since it gives the recommened 7h30m of sleep. The schedule for Siesta-extended is 6h of sleep in the night (4 cycles), and 1,5h core in the day (1 cycle). 

E1 is a strange one. It has the possibility to be too easy, and you could have to wait several weeks to be able to sleep for the nap, since so little sleep is actually cut (for underaged people more sleep is actually cut, so it might still be relativly easy to learn to fall asleep for the nap). If you go for E1 without previous napping experience and you fail to fall asleep for the naps within a reasonable timeframe see !fallasleep. 

Segmented is a bit harder, but still easy. It's better to do segmented if you normally wake up in the night. Otherwise the quality of the sleep should be the same as the rest.

They work with different mechanics though; Siesta takes advantage of the statistically more likely rem period that happens at the 4,5-5h mark, and adds a cycle in the day. E1 trades a full cycle (of light sleep and rem) for a rem-filled nap, while segmented removes a cycle and makes the cycles longer to compensate.

You can look at each of them in <#257401368807997440> with the commands +siesta +segmented and +e1.
