Caffeine shouldn't be consumed at all during adaptation. It can help you, but you'll feel worse after the effects of the caffeine fade out. Caffeine's half-life is on average 6.5h (the time it takes for the caffeine amount in your body to be halved; it takes about 12-18h to be mostly removed). Therefore, it's better to consume decaffeinated drinks.

Caffeine replaces valuable REM and SWS with light sleep, meaning that even if you would fall asleep, your quality suffers a lot.

The one exception is Segmented; here it's okay to consume a moderate amount in the morning. Note that use past noon should still be avoided.
