During adaptation your memory can be expected to be impaired due to lowered amounts of REM and SWS, but after adaptation it will restored to that of a natural wakes mono or possibly better due to the frequent breaks (naps). 

SWS is responsible for storage of declarative/explicit memory, i.e. recall of explicit factual information. like if you study for a history, or a biology test. X happened on date Y. A in the body does thing B.

REM is responsible for storage of procedural memory, i.e. remembering how to do certain things by following a procedure. example include how to walk, how to ride a bike, how to play a specific piano piece. Rem is also responsible for emotionally related memory consolidation, and for spatial memory consolidation (together with light sleep), i.e. which way to walk to your friends house. 

If you're trying to remember procedures by repetition, napping is a good way to boost that. if you're trying to remember chunks of information, you won't get any gain there until your core sleep and its best to study that stuff before the core.

If you have to follow some procedure every time, for example you do X, then Y, then Z, and it leads to Q, and you're following the procedure over and over, REM sleep will help. If you have to just recall some piece of information off the top of your head, SWS sleep will help. 

Many things require a bit of both SWS and REM. When you are learning something you probably have some sort of impact on most of the memory types, so getting good quality sleep is going to help you regardless, it's better to study, sleep, then take the test, than it is to pull an all nighter. you're much more likely to have good recall after sleeping.
