***Falling asleep:***
Try to lower your body temperature to fall asleep more easily. Create a sleep-inducing environment like the dark, try focusing on your breath, inhale and exhale at regular intervals.
Keep away from thoughts; perhaps try reading something entertaining before bed. Have a hot shower around 1h before sleep time. listen to lulling music, brown/white noise or ASMR. Stay away from electronics (esp. screens) at least 15m before bedtime.

If you fail to fall asleep even after a long time on the schedule doing a harder one, like Naptation, E3 etc, until you fall asleep reliably is an option. The ability to nap is a skill that's been anecdotally proven to stick even after going back to mono for a long time, so recovering after learning to fall asleep is recommended. See !recovery
