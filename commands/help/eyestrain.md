***Eyestrain:***
If you have problems with eye strain during screen use, it is suggested that you take regular breaks and switch to paper media for reading. Also from 2h prior to the core for 6-8h (preferably 8h) forwards you should only allow red light to hit your eyes. Do this by using programs such as F.lux on your computer, by having red light in your house, or by wearing red-tinted glasses.
