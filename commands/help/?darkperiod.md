Melatonin is essential for entering SWS, however it's production is delayed by all light types except red. Because of this all non-red light types should be completly blocked off during the dark period, which should start 2h prior to the core (first core on DC schedules, night core on Triphasic) and continue for 6-8h (preferably 8h) after that. The reason it should continue even after your wake time (if you have a short core) is to ensure the stability of the circadian rhythm. Darkness is stil prefered over red light, so using night themes is the best option. The light blocking can be done by either wearing blue-green light blocking glasses or by using programs such as F.lux, sunsetscreen etc on a low kelvin setting (around 1000K). Having red lightbulbs is also an option. 

Schedule line specifics
DC: if your cores are within 5h from eachother the dark period should cover the whole core gap.
E: if the first nap is relativly close to the core you should have the dark period extended until the end of it.
Triphasic: the gap between the night and dawn cores should be covered in the dark period
