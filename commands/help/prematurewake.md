If you naturaly wake prematurely (<5m on a nap, <30m on a core), get out of bed. Don't try to cram in more sleep until the alarm rings. You might fall asleep and wake up in SWS, or sleep through your alarm. Falling back asleep could also be difficult and thus you'd spend time unnecessarily trying to do so.
