Signs to recognize when you have adapted to a schedule:
1. Fall asleep fast in all sleeps, even if you don't prepare some time beforehand to sleep. 
2. Remember more dreams from your sleep, and more vivid dreams (the dreams can come from the end of your core sleep, or you can even dream right when you fall asleep shortly)
3. Wake up feeling refreshed whether the nap or the core. No sleep inertia.
4. Wake naturally without the need for alarms (long entrainment with a sleep cycle - takes a long time to achieve this)
5. Feels energized and productive when awake, no memory loss, elevation in mood and good appetite.
