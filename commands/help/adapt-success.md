Signs to recognize when you have adapted to a schedule, in order of importance:
1. Feel energized and productive when awake, no memory loss, elevation in mood and good appetite.
2. Wake up feeling refreshed whether the nap or the core. No sleep inertia.
3. Fall asleep fast in all sleeps, even if you don't prepare some time beforehand to sleep. 
4. Wake naturally without the need for alarms.  This requires long entrainment with a sleep cycle, often months for it to be consistent. 
5. You might remember more dreams from your sleep, and more vivid dreams (the dreams can come from the end of your core sleep, or you can even dream right when you fall asleep shortly). Some people remember fewer dreams, due to consistently waking from light sleep as an adaptation to rigid sleep times.
