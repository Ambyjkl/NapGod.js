A very limited amount of research has been done with regards to cannabis affecting sleep. Research and anecdotal evidence points to cannabis reducing the amount of REM sleep and increasing SWS, possibly also increasing it's daily need. Because of this it should be completely avoided during adaptation, and consumption should atleast be kept at a moderate amount after adaptation. See !drugs.
