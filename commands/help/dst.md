DST is known as Daylight Saving Time.

DST can be hard on your schedule, since rotating it during adaptation will confuse your body as to when it's supposed to sleep. Tiredness/groggyness during the wrong times is not uncommon. There are 3 ways to deal with DST:

***1.*** 
Rotate the schedule 1h in a single day.
Pros: fast change, works if schedule doesn't allow anything else
Cons: sets your adaptation back several days, and you'll feel groggy for a while, increasing the risk of oversleeps

***2.*** 
Switch by a small amount of time for a number of days (max around 10m/day)
Pros: might not actually set you back at all
Cons: takes a long time and precise planning to execute. Also requires a schedule that allows this

***3.*** 
Stick to the old schedule
Pros: no setback whatsoever
Cons: requires you to have a schedule that allows it

If you're planning to start a polyphasic sleep schedule but have DST coming up soon it's wise to either go with the schedule you'll end up with in the end or wait until DST passes before switching schedules.
