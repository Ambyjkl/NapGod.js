Recovery is the concept of sleeping with natural wakes until all sleep deprivation is gone. This is usually done for 1-2 weeks, but it can take less time or more time depending on the amount of sleep deprivation accumulated. While doing recovery one should have a set time for the start of the sleep.

Recovery is usually done:
-before doing a polyphasic sleep schedule, if one is sleep deprived
-after falling into OS
-after one oversleep so big you know you won't be able to continue due to the huge setback.

Mono-recovery is the prefered recovering schedule (one core), but it's also possible to recover on biphasic schedules (will likely take longer due to the alleviated sleep deprivation during the day):
E1-recovery, one 20m nap during the day and a core in the night without an alarm
Siesta-recovery, one 90m core during the day and a core in the night without an alarm
Segmented-recovery, one 3,5h core, followed by a break and another core without an alarm.

Recovering from a polyphasic schedulue often follows this pattern
x-days with short wakes
-> y-days with long wakes
-> 2-3 days of wakes of the usual length
This is when one is done recovering, when the sleep has stabilized at a set length that's of similar length to before attempting polyphasic sleep, around 6-8h for most adults

If recovery with natural wakes is impossible due to scheduling limitations doing it with as much sleep as one can get is possible, but recovering will take a longer amount of time.
