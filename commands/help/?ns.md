NS stands for Newcomer Syndrome, which often happens to new polyphasic sleepers, who aim for the hardest sleep schedules like Uberman, Tesla, and  Dymaxion; knowing that they DON'T have the mutations to sleep way less in the day without ever feeling tired (If you have this gene, you have known it by the time you became an adult already). This syndrome is severe because it cultivates the misconception that everyone can sleep as little as 2 hours per day; while gaining superhuman productivity. (You most likely can not.)

The adaptation to these hostile schedules is extremely severe, let alone sticking with them long term (can still cause physical/mental exhaustion long-term, due to the great lack of amount of deep sleep stages to provide sufficient recovery for daily sleep need). 

If you're a newcomer, please be realistic in choosing a suitable sleep schedule for yourself, and take your time to consider what's best for your own well-being.
Try to stay above 4h of sleep if you're over 21. If you're between 18 and 21 you should get at least 5 hours of sleep, and if you're underage, see !underage
