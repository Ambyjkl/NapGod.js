Your circadian rythm is set by blue light and food intake (also partly by temperature and physical activity); to keep it intact it's wise to keep a 6-12 (preferably 8-10) hour dark period (with only red light allowed, see !darkperiod) coinciding with an 8-12  hour fasting period. Both the dark period and the fasting should start 2h prior to the core. Not doing so has a major bad influence on your core's sleep quality, and leads to elevated risks of getting diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. 

The length of the dark period can directly affect the amount of SWS in the core, which means minor tweaking of the length of the dark period can be benefitial in order to get high amounts of quality sleep. The effects are easiest seen with a sleep tracker, see !sleeptracker. 

If your core doesn't start 20-24 it is wise to have the dark period be slightly cooler than the rest of the day. In this case getting a daylight lamp to use outside of the dark period is also recommended.

Also try to limit physical activities during the dark period.
