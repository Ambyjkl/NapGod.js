***Dual Core schedules:***
The idea with the Dual Core (DC) line is to split the core into 2 parts to hit both the sws (21-24) and rem (06-09) peaks to acchieve the highest quality sleep. Due to the placement of the cores the first core will contain mostly SWS, while the other one will contain mostly REM.
People who often wake up during the night without being able to fall back asleep easily are often naturally Segmented, and the DC-line is recommended for them.
Cycle compression is present in the DC-line (see !compression).
If you aren't able to sleep at these times ask in #beginners if you will be able to adapt to a DC schedule!
