--  Take some time to prepare for your schedule if possible. Quit caffeine, nicotine, drugs and extra sugar before starting. Start eating healthier and exercising. 
--  Begin teaching yourself to get up the moment you wake up. Start having both a night and morning routine.
--  Inform people around you about what you will be doing and how this is going to be affecting both you and them. 
--  Start scouting out possible locations where you can nap. 
--  Read up to understand polyphasic adaptation and what to expect. That includes other !help  commands like !adaptation and !os, <https://polyphasic.net/>, and asking any questions in the Discord.
--  Consider shifting your current core wake time or bedtime toward your new core's bedtime or wake time, if either is possible.
--  Install and practice using all apps you may need, like alarm apps, F.lux/Twilight/Sunsetscreen, or productivity apps.
--  Ensure your health and safety if you have any stress-aggravated medical conditions, like cardiovascular problems or seizures or suicidal thoughts, as you will be going through weeks of mild to severe sleep deprivation. Severity depends on the person and the schedule.  See a doctor to determine if short-term sleep deprivation is an acceptable risk for you.
--  Create at least two huge lists:
1) Tasks toward major, motivating goals that inspire your interest in more time or better sleep.
2) Easy, time-consuming tasks that you can make yourself do while tired and unmotivated, like cleaning or cooking.
