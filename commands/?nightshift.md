For those who work night shifts, polyphasic sleep can be possible, if:
1. You can have a short nap at work. 
2. Your night shift schedule is stable everyday, for a long time to come. 
3. You don't have any health problems (night shift workers tend to have higher blood pressure, heart rate, even some sleep disorders, due to messed-up biological clock).
For health benefits, any form of biphasic sleep is a good choice. One core sleep after work, when you go home, and a small nap before you go to work is a good approach to take on. Everyman sleep can be chosen, but, beware of tougher adaptation process.
