1. Cold turkey: You jump straight from monosleep into your desired schedule.

2. Naptation: Stay awake for around 36h then start napping for 20m (adapting to nap-only schedules like Uberman), to practice napping.

3. Gradual adaptation: start with easy schedules, then move to harder ones by cutting down total sleep after each adaptation.
