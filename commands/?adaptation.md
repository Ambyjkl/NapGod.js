***First stage:*** 
Sleep and wake up are so easy in each sleep, core sleep and naps, because sleep deprivation hasn't kicked in. Sleep quality is the same as in monosleep. Sleep stages haven't compressed. Sleep cycle is still the same (90m one cycle, presumably).

***Second stage:*** 
Starts feeling tired in the day, at some points of time. Waking up becomes harder, as total sleep is reduced. Feeling of sleepiness becomes more apparent, and sleep debts accumulate. 

***Third stage:***
This is where the screwups begin. Sleep debts accumulate enough to often cause an oversleep. Here it's important to maximize your alarms. (if and how much you oversleep depends on how much sleep you get in your schedule. The shorter it is, the more likely you are to oversleep). This is also the stage where you start to remember dreams in your nap(s)/core(s), as well as falling asleep has become very easy (feeling tired/sleepy a lot in the day). You start to know how to nap, but, waking up is a major issue at this point. Sleep stage compression has begun. Your sleep cycle can be reduced, with the reduction of light sleep. 

***Fourth stage:*** 
Adaptation success, if you bypass stage 3 without oversleeping much! Now, you can wake naturally before alarm rings sometimes, have more vivid dreams, and fall asleep is no longer an issue. The difference is, waking up is very easy, and you also feel alert in the day. When nap times come, sleepiness sharply rise at that moment, and when you wake up from nap, you're fresh again till the next sleep.
