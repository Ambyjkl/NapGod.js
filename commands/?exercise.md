***Exercise:***
People who do alot of intense muscle building (HIIT, lifting, etc) need at least 3 cycles in their core (first core for DC) to handle the increased SWS need. Cardio doesn't increase the SWS need significantly.

Most people should leave a 2h gap between exercising and sleeping in order to avoid having the exercising interfere with the sleep.
It is advised to do cardio in the morning and lifting in the evening post-adaptation. 

During adaptation it's best to avoid increasing the SWS need, since it can cause an oversleep later. Because sleep deprivation hinders muscle gain, you also won't get the desired results.

Exercising can be beneficial to you during adaptation, if it's integrated into your morning routine to avoid oversleeping.
