When choosing a polyphasic lifestyle, before attempting a schedule, please make sure you think through of the following:

***1.*** Are you below 18? If you are, it's still possible to be polyphasic, but it's important not to reduce sleep lower than 7 hours. For more info, see !underage

***2.*** Do you have sleep disorders? If you have insomnia, polyphasic sleep will help you. If you have other severe disorders like narcolepsy, sleep apnea, or something else, you shouldn't become polyphasic, or should consult a physician about your conditions first. 

***3.*** Do you have any physical illnesses? If you have chronic diseases like diabetes, again, consult your physician. 

***4.*** Can you be polyphasic long term? Look ahead in your work/study schedule, and your future life, several months ahead. Adaptation to a sleep schedule usually takes one month, if you're strict. So, if you only have, for example, a month and a half, you shouldn't attempt polyphasic sleep at all, because you have little time to enjoy the period of success before having to switch. It's then just not worth the effort and and reduced productivity you put in.
