***Falling asleep:***
Try to lower your body temperature to fall asleep more easily. Create a sleep-inducing environment like the dark, try focusing on your breath, inhale and exhale at regular intervals.
Keep away from thoughts; perhaps try reading something entertaining before bed. Have a hot shower around 1h before sleep time. listen to lulling music, brown/white noise or ASMR. Stay away from electronics (esp. screens) at least 15m before bedtime.
