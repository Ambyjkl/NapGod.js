Your circadian rythm is set by blue light and food intake (also partly by temperature and physical activity); to keep it intact it's wise to keep a 6-8 (preferably 8) hour dark period (with only red light allowed, see !darkperiod) coinciding with an 8-12  hour fasting period. Both the dark period and the fasting should start 2h prior to the core. Not doing so has a major influence on your core's sleep quality, and leads to elevated risks of getting diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. 
If your core doesn't start 20-24 it is wise to have the dark period be slightly cooler than the rest of the day. In this case getting a daylight lamp to use outside of the dark period is also recommended.
Also try to limit physical activities during the dark period.
