***Everyman:***
The Everyman (E) line has one single core and an amount of naps during the day. The idea behind this line is that 90m chunks of the core are traded for an equivalent number of 20m naps during the day.

The core of the E schedules can be scheduled slightly later than the DC ones, since the core should contain both SWS and REM. 
*A too late core will not get you sufficient SWS*

After adaptation the naps of E1 and E2 can be quite flexible; in order to gain some flexibility with E3 the core has to be extended to 3,5h. DO NOT flex at all during adaptation.
E4 is below the minimum sleep threshold, and should generally be avoided.
