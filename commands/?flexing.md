- Flexing means to start one or more scheduled sleeps at different times on different days, keeping the sleep length the same.   It's strongly discouraged for beginner polysleepers, and has the best chance of success after being adapted for a month or two to a strict schedule. 
- Nap times can be flexed as little as 15 minutes in either direction, or as much as 2-3hours either direction, which takes longer to adapt to. 
- Always keep at least 2-3hrs gap between sleeps even if flexing.
- Napping in peak SWS pressure of circadian rhythm (broadly 20:00 through 02:00) is still strongly discouraged. 
- Gradually increasing flex range is recommended, and you can start with flexing just one nap to be safe.
- Flexing the core is risky and not recommended, but possible to a small degree for experienced polysleepers.
- Length of adaptation takes some number of weeks that increases with difficulty of base schedule, number of sleeps flexed, range of flexing, and how much (if at all) you are flexing a core.

- Tricks to make flexing a schedule easier:
> don't flex core, 
> increase core lengths 30m (e.g. to 3.5h for E3 or 5h for E2), 
> increase core lengths by a 90m cycle (e.g. to 4.5h for E3 or 6h for E2)
> don't flex the first nap, if there are more than one
> choose a schedule with at least 5.5hrs total sleep per day.  (As far as only 4.5h daily,  several people have adapted to flexing naps in E3 with a 3.5h core and a stable first nap.)
