Depending on how much sleep you sleep on monophasic schedule, sleep debt can hit you hard or not at all when you are adapting to a polyphasic pattern. Generally, expect sleep debts to build and hit you around week 2 or 3, if you don't oversleep.
Eventualy the sleep debt will allow you to fall asleep instantly for your sleeps.
When enough sleep debt builds up you'll get a REM rebound, which inserts REM into the beginning of every sleep, and on schedules with a split SWS core/with low amounts of sleep you can also expect an SWS rebound to occour.
Repartition happens because of sleep debt and sticking to your schedule, see !repartition
