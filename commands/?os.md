OS stands for Oversleeping Syndrome. This applies to those who keep oversleeping when adapting to a sleep schedule, but still keep moving on and claiming they will adapt eventually. The syndrome is also fatal for adaptation, because:

***1.*** 
Keep oversleeping and trying to adapt will mess up circadian rhythm and sleep compression entirely. The body is trying to adjust to a certain sleep cycle length, but this can only happen with NO oversleeping.

***2.*** 
As sleep is not stabilized (oversleeping when supposed to be awake), the person will fail to adapt to a schedule and thus will constantly be plagued in sleep deprivation. Long-term sleep deprivation leads to obesity, diabetes, increased heart rate, headaches, fatigue, frequent anger, etc...

The solution to cure this syndrome, is to go back to monophasic sleep for at least 1-2 weeks to regain homeostasis, then attempt to adapt to a polyphasic schedule again. This is called "Recovery"
