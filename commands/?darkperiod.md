During the dark period which starts 2 hours before the start of the core (first core with DC schedules, night core on triphasic) and continues for 6-8 (preferably 8) hours you should filter out all light but red. Getting a pair of red laser protection glasses (very cheap) (or other blue-blocking glasses) and installing F.lux on your computer (use a low kelvin during this period) is recommended.

For why this is important, see !circadian
